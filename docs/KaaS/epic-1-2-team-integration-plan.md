## 🎯 Epic Overview

### Epic 1: Discover Curated Content (Universal)
- **Goal:** Build content pipeline for weekly digest (one version for all users)
- **FRs covered:** FR-1.1, FR-1.2, FR-2.1, FR-2.2, FR-2.3, FR-5.1, FR-7.1, FR-9.1
- **Stories:**
  - Story 1.1: Status Check — Audit existing code, DB, infrastructure
  - Story 1.2: Daily Publication Pipeline — Notion → Postgres → GitHub
  - Story 1.3: Discover & Configure Additional Source — Source configuration UI

### Epic 2: Learn Structured Concepts (Universal)
- **Goal:** Build knowledge graph + Writer Agent for concept pages
- **FRs covered:** FR-3.1, FR-3.2, FR-3.3, FR-4.1, FR-4.2, FR-4.3, FR-4.4, FR-7.2, FR-8.1

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack (Per ADR-006)
- **TypeScript:** Web backend, cron job scripts, HTTP, Notion/GitHub API calls, job orchestration
- **Python:** LLM calls, PDF parsing, GraphDB queries, vector operations
- **PostgreSQL 16 + pgvector:** Evidence layer, embeddings (except ChromaDB for ontology)
- **AWS Neptune:** GraphDB for Concept layer (production)
- **ChromaDB:** Vector store for ontology package (temporary, may migrate to pgvector)

### Communication Architecture
```
TypeScript (Orchestrator)
    │
    ├── Python API (HTTP or stdio)
    │   ├── ETL Pipeline (PDF → Chunks → Embeddings)
    │   ├── AI Agent (Writer Agent, Ontology Extraction)
    │   └── GraphDB Client (SPARQL queries)
    │
    └── PostgreSQL (pgvector, Evidence layer, Content layer)
```

### Key ADR References
- **ADR-001:** GraphDB over Neo4j for Concept Layer
- **ADR-002:** Notion as Source of Truth (Postgres is one-way backup)
- **ADR-003:** pgvector over standalone vector database
- **ADR-004:** Next.js Webapp (content layer)
- **ADR-005:** Cron over Airflow for pipeline scheduling
- **ADR-006:** TypeScript for orchestration; Python for LLM/PDF/GraphDB
- **ADR-007:** Loose coupling via `extracted_concept` string field
- **ADR-008:** Tailscale for Infrastructure Access

## 📋 API Contract (CRITICAL — Must Define Before Implementation)

### Python ↔ TypeScript Communication Protocol

**Decision:** HTTP REST API with JSON payloads

#### Option A: HTTP API (Recommended)

## 🔄 Daily Standup Format (15 minutes)

**Time:** 9:00 AM daily
**Channel:** Slack/Discord

**Format:**
1. **Yesterday:** What I completed, what blocked me
2. **Today:** What I plan to work on
3. **Blockers:** What I need from others

**Example:**
```
ETL Pipeline Builder:
✅ Implemented /pdf/extract endpoint
✅ Tested with sample PDF
→ Today: Implement /pdf/chunk endpoint
⚠️ Need: API contract confirmation from Tech Lead

AI Engineer:
✅ Reviewed ontology package
→ Today: Start FastAPI server setup
⚠️ Need: GraphDB connection details from Tech Lead

Web Dev:
✅ Created Python HTTP client skeleton
→ Today: Implement orchestrator job for pdf-ingestion
⚠️ Need: Python API base URL from team

Tech Lead:
→ Today: Set up local GraphDB, create migration scripts
⚠️️ Need: API contract sign-off from all
```

## ⚠️ Risk Management

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Owner | Mitigation |
|------|-------|------------|
| Python↔TS API contract changes | All | Sign-off contract before Day 4, document all changes |
| GraphDB connection issues | AI Engineer + Tech Lead | Test GraphDB early, have local fallback |
| PDF extraction edge cases | ETL Pipeline Builder | Test with various PDFs, document limitations |
| LLM API rate limits | AI Engineer | Implement batching, error handling, retry logic |
| Memory leaks in TS→Python calls | Web Dev | Monitor memory, use connection pooling |
| Migration conflicts | SQL Dev + Tech Lead | Incremental migrations, test on backup first |

### Coordination Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| API contract misunderstandings | Document in OpenAPI/Swagger, get sign-off |
| Integration testing delays | Daily standup, shared testing environment |
| Rollback confusion | Clear rollback procedures, only Tech Lead can trigger |
| Environment setup issues | Document setup steps, share troubleshooting guides |

---

## 🚀 Rollback Procedures

### Level 1: Minor Issue (Keep Integration Work)
```bash
# Undo last commit, keep changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1
# Fix issues, re-commit
```

### Level 2: Moderate Issue (Reset to Integration Start)
```bash
# Reset to backup tag, keep files
git reset pre-epic-1-2-integration-*
# Review and fix
```

### Level 3: Major Issue (Full Abandon)
```bash
# Return to main, keep integration branch as reference
git checkout main
git branch -D epic-1-2-integration

# Or full reset (loses integration work)
git checkout main
git reset --hard pre-epic-1-2-integration-*
```
