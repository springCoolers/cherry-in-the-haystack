## Executive Summary

**cherry-in-the-haystack** evolves from a personal content curation tool into **Cherry for AI Engineers** — a living, community-driven knowledge base with personalized intelligence and content creation capabilities.

The product addresses the critical problem of fragmented, rapidly-changing LLM knowledge that overwhelms practitioners. Engineers, builders, and product teams currently rely on scattered Twitter posts, Discord chats, papers, repos, and blog updates that become outdated within weeks. There is no single, living source of truth that organizes this knowledge and helps people make practical decisions when building real AI products.

**Cherry for AI Engineers provides:**
- **Community-Curated Knowledge Base:** Continuously updated, structured map of what matters right now
- **Personalized Intelligence Platform:** Custom feeds and scoring based on individual needs
- **Adaptive Knowledge Base:** User-controlled topics with custom evidence and Writer Agent regeneration
- **Newsletter Studio (Enterprise):** AI-powered content creation from curated sources to polished newsletters in minutes
- Clear explanations, trade-offs, and practical examples
- Collective intelligence that compounds instead of fading
- Orientation in a chaotic, fast-moving landscape
- Living knowledge graph connecting concepts, evidence, and sources

**Product Evolution:**
- **Free Tier:** Full access to community-curated knowledge via web application with limited personalization(custom sources)
- **Paid Tiers:** More personalization; adaptive knowledge base
- **Enterprise Tier:** Newsletter Studio for marketing teams to create promotional content at scale

### What Makes This Special

**"Orientation in chaos through collective intelligence that compounds — personalized to your needs."**

This isn't just documentation — it's a living, community-curated knowledge platform that adapts to each user while being sustained by active practitioners. The magic happens at multiple levels:

> *"This isn't just information — it's the exact distillation of what I needed, at the right level, personalized to what matters to me, and always up-to-date."*

**The "Wow" Moments:**

**For Individual Practitioners (Free & Paid):**
- A founder reads "Choosing your embedding model" and instantly knows the trade-offs for their use case
- An engineer finds a clean, minimal reference architecture for retrieval or agent orchestration that just clicks
- A newcomer sees they can follow the map instead of drowning in noise
- **Personalized feed:** "My feed only shows what matters to me, scored exactly how I want"
- **Adaptive digest:** "My weekly digest and tech map only surfaces what's relevant to my work"
- **Custom knowledge base:** "I added my company's internal docs, and Cherry rewrote pages with my context"
- Users experience: **Clarity** ("Ah, now I understand"), **Confidence** ("I know which approach to choose"), and **Speed** ("I caught up in minutes, not days")

**For Enterprise Teams (Newsletter Studio):**
- A marketing team turns 100 curated sources into a polished promotional newsletter in 15 minutes instead of 4 hours
- Content teams A/B test different newsletter angles with version history
- Companies maintain consistent voice and quality across all external communications
- **The Enterprise Magic:** "We went from manual curation chaos to automated intelligence at scale"
