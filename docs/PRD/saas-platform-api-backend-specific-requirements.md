## Concept Page Structure (UI Design)

**Design Philosophy:** Four-section progressive learning structure with MECE organization throughout.

**Page Layout for Basics/Advanced Concepts (Applied to ALL users - Free & Paid):**

```
# [Concept Title]

# 1. Overview
**What is [Concept]?**
- 1-2 sentence definition
- Why this matters to engineers
- Context and practical relevance
- Real-world problem this solves

**When to use:**
- Situational guidance
- Use cases and anti-patterns

# 2. Cherries
MECE-structured key insights from ingested books and sources on this concept:

- **[Source Title A]** — [Distinct insight or framing this source provides]
- **[Source Title B]** — [Different angle or aspect not covered by A]
- **[Source Title C]** — [Further non-overlapping insight]

*(Each cherry is a valuable piece picked from the haystack of source material — non-overlapping, collectively exhaustive)*

# 3. Child Concepts / Co-occurring Concepts
These concepts are commonly used together or build upon [Concept]:

## Prerequisite Concepts
- **[Related Concept A]** — Brief description of relationship
  - Why it matters: [1-line explanation]
  - Link to concept page

- **[Related Concept B]** — Brief description of relationship
  - Why it matters: [1-line explanation]
  - Link to concept page

## Related Concepts (Co-occurring)
- **[Concept X]** — Often used together (e.g., RAG + Reranking)
- **[Concept Y]** — Alternative or complementary approach

## Subtopics (Child Concepts)
- **[Narrower Concept]** — Specific implementation or technique
- Links to detailed pages for each

## Extensions (Advanced)
- **[Advanced Concept]** — Building on this foundation
- Links to Advanced section

# 4. Progressive References (MECE Learning Path)

**Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive reference organization:**

📚 **Start Here** (Beginner-Friendly Introduction)
1. **[Reference A: Title]**
   - What it covers: Broad, easy introduction to [Concept]
   - Format: Blog post / Tutorial / Book chapter
   - Reading time: ~20 minutes
   - Why start here: Best foundational overview
   - Link: [URL]

📖 **Next** (Builds on Previous)

---

**Contributors:** [Knowledge Team members who curated this concept]

[Optional: Interactive graph visualization showing this concept's position in knowledge graph]
```

**Key Design Principles:**

1. **Overview Section:**
   - Answers "What is this?" and "Why should I care?"
   - Provides immediate context and value proposition
   - Accessible to all skill levels

2. **Cherries Section:**
   - Shows what authoritative sources actually say — no AI invention
   - MECE: each entry covers a distinct aspect of the concept (Mutually Exclusive)
   - Together, entries give a complete picture of the concept across literature (Collectively Exhaustive)
   - Source attribution on every entry enforces the no-hallucination guarantee

3. **Child Concepts Section:**
   - Shows relationships from Graph DB ontology
   - Helps users navigate knowledge graph
   - Prerequisite → Related → Subtopics → Extensions hierarchy
   - Each relation type rendered only if exists (dynamic)

4. **Progressive References (MECE):**
   - **Mutually Exclusive:** Each reference covers unique aspects, minimal overlap
   - **Collectively Exhaustive:** Together, references provide complete understanding
   - **Progressive Difficulty:** Start easy, increase complexity
   - **Value Explanation:** Each reference explicitly states what unique value it adds
   - **Clear Sequencing:** Reading order optimized for learning efficiency

## Content Storage Architecture

**Database-Driven Content Management:**

- Community content stored in relational database (PostgreSQL)
- Graph database for concept ontology and relationships (Neo4j or compatible)
- Vector database for deduplication only (Milvus, ChromaDB, or Pinecone)
- Content Ingestion Pipeline codebase integrated with main application

**Content Database Schema:**

```
Tables:
- concepts: id, title, summary, section (basics/advanced), created_at, updated_at
- concept_relationships: id, from_concept_id, to_concept_id, relationship_type (prerequisite/related/subtopic/extends/contradicts)
- evidence: id, source, location, text, excerpt, comment, tags, created_at
- concept_evidence_links: concept_id, evidence_id
- references: id, concept_id, title, url, description, learning_order, reading_time, difficulty_level
- newly_discovered: id, category, title, summary, score, source, published_at, reviewed_at
- users: id, email, tier (free/paid/enterprise), preferences_json, created_at
- user_sources: user_id, source_url, source_type, active
- user_reading_history: user_id, content_id, content_type, read_at
- newsletters: id, user_id, config_json, draft, version, created_at, updated_at
```

**Parent-Child Concept Hierarchy:**

- **Parent:** High-level concept (stored as concept with no parent relationship)
- **Child:** Specific implementations (stored as concept with "subtopic" relationship to parent)
- Maximum 2 levels of depth to maintain clarity and navigation simplicity
- Navigation structure built dynamically from concept_relationships table

## Automation & Deployment Requirements
