  "topic": "RAG evaluation",
  "summary": "RAG evaluation refers to the systematic assessment of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models that combine retrieval mechanisms with generative language modeling to improve performance on tasks such as question answering and information retrieval. This evaluation employs diverse metrics including exact match, functional correctness, and text similarity, focusing on benchmarking models to measure quality, comparative ranking, and guiding iterative development. Embedded within AI and LLM engineering best practices, RAG evaluation forms a critical part of the AI model lifecycle, from training pipelines to deployment, within a data-centric architecture that supports flexibility and continuous improvement.",
  "why_it_matters": "RAG evaluation is vital for ensuring the effectiveness and reliability of hybrid retrieval-generative systems that enhance language model capabilities. It addresses the complexities inherent in both retrieval and generation, enabling precise measurement of model quality and comparison across multiple approaches. This informs development choices, maintains high standards for AI applications, supports ongoing model refinement, and ultimately leads to more accurate, contextually relevant, and robust AI-powered systems in real-world use cases.",
